# gaussian

Huff implementation of the gaussian CDF function with 1e8 precision

### This unfortunately is still a WIP
this is my first time experimenting with huff, unfortunately i ran into some weird precision issues and i didn't have the time to write tests (all of the testing took place at [Huff playground](https://oguimbal.github.io/huff/)) and make proper comments.
